# About FutureMakers2022:
This repository contains files I worked on during the FutureMakers program by SureStart in summer 2022. In the first part of the program, I attended lectures and completed coding homework. In the second part (Create-a-thon), my team and I worked on Legal Linguists, a translation tool. We presented this result in a pitch meeting hosted by MIT, and out of 16 competing teams, we won the grand prize. 

# Files:
  1. Day1 to Day 17

These python notebooks are coding homework I completed during the first part of the FutureMakers 2022 program. They are coding and written problems on AI and machine learning.

  2. OCR_Module.ipynb
This is the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) Module for Legal Linguists. I used the ocrmypdf and pdfplumber modules, following youtube tutorial. At the end, I convert the output of the modules into a list of Strings, so that the Translation Module of our tool can translate the words one by one. 
 
  3. Web_Scrapign_Workshop.ipynb
This is code I wrote during a web-scraping workshop in the FutureMakers program. I used BeautifulSoup to extract text data from www.fsis.usda.gov. 

  4. OCR_prototype_02.ipynb
Prototype for the OCR_Module project; I used pdf2image and easyocr. This method is not streamlined because I first need to convert input images into the desired format before running OCR on it.
